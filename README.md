# CS315 Final Project

Example parameters for sequential:
./amr 10 1000 5 5 5 5 5

Example parameters for parallel:
./amr -i 10 -n 1000 -r 5 -rl 5 -rp 5 -rd 5 -ri 5

Alex said that there was some "LifeLine" mapper or something that did load balancing of
tasks. It would be interesting to look into that once I start to paralellize this algorithm.
